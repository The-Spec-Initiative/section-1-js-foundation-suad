# Data Types

Tackling the different data types in javascript

# Feature

Created an object which contains three datatypes:

- number(age)
  -string(name)
  -isLoggedIn(boolean)

The object was stored using a const, because we're not going to reassign it to another value

# Technologies

- Javascript
  -HTML
