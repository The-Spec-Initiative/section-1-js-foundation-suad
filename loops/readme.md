# Loops

Wrote a program that loops over an array using the forEach method

# How it works

```js
const users = ["lee", "maa", "daa", "levi", "eren"];

users.forEach((el) => console.log(el));
```

An array of users is created, and we used the foreach method to loop over each element, so its being logged to the console
